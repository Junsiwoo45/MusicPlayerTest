Gregor.io and Tyler will be working on getting the like button for posts working, as well as a form to create posts. The form will serve as a springboard for automated post creation (e.g. when a room is created, or a user likes a song), but that part will be easier once posts are able to get created.

Sione - I will rotate between all users to help them integrate their components. Additionally I will be adjusting and fixing any bugs or issues with interface.Once. Additionally I will continue to work on the rooms for additionally feature and music syncing.

Hayden - Working with Juan and Sione to fix the Spotify API to add to queue(400/500) Errors. Integrate this Spotify component into the rooms with Sione and Juan. Also trying to sync the Music up between users in the room. 

Juan - Continue working with Hayden. Fix Authentication errors when making API requests (currently receiving 400/500 type errors from the API). Integrate rooms, with Sione, by allowing 2 users to add a song to the queue in the same room instance.
